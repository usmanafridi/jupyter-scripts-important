# That is when I started Programing!!!

<p> Ahh looking back at my old Jupyter Notebook files, that is when I started my career as a Data Scientist and was on internship. Who would have thought that I will come this far. </p>

<p> I have just added these old scripts just in case someone need any motivation, or if someone wants to learn from it. </p>

<p> My favorite one among these notebooks is connecting with MySQL. I tried to be an EXPERT PROGRAMMER and wanted to connect with MySQL dynamically, i.e. wanting input at runtime. haha that was a small achievement but it really made me feel good about myself, as I have achieved something original!! LOL. </p>

<br />

<p> The other notebook is finding a word in PDF documents using Python scripts and with PyPDF library. Feel free to explore it yourself. </p>
